      <h2>Castle Internal Regulations</h2>

      <p>
        The estate of the Castle, including its park, outbuildings and castle,
        is private property. Therefore, it is governed by specific internal
        regulations, and anyone wishing to visit or stay on the estate must
        comply with the regulations below, under penalty of being denied access.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you may know, our residence is connected to a mysterious shadow area
        that could be considered paranormal. Therefore, access to the castle is
        strongly discouraged for pregnant women and people with heart
        conditions, and minors unaccompanied are prohibited.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        It is mandatory for anyone visiting the estate to spend one or more
        nights to be in possession of the civil liability waiver that is
        available on the site. Without it, access to the castle will be denied.
      </p>

      <p>
        The castle is a private property registered as a historical monument,
        and visitors are required to respect the place and its history. Any
        person engaging in a frivolous or suspicious attitude may be expelled
        from the premises at the discretion of the owners. Any photo or video
        taken out of context, aimed at tarnishing the image of the place and
        posted online including the name of the estate may be subject to legal
        action.

        If you plan to make a paranormal investigation film, please send us your
        synopsis and request for filming authorization. Our animal friends are
        not allowed on the property. Only the dining room fireplace may be used.
        It is your duty to respect the boundaries indicated by the tape and not
        to cross them under any circumstances. They indicate a dangerous
        construction area strictly prohibited to the public.

        Alcohol must be consumed in moderation at the castle to avoid any
        overflow and damage. Please download this civil liability waiver if you
        wish to come to Bloody Castle, sign it, and also read and sign the
        internal regulations. Download the civil liability waiver.
